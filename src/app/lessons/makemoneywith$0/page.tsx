            Building a business with $0:
          </h3>
          <p>
            You have <b>no capital</b> so you need to sell something that
            requires no costs, apart from your time. Which is why you will be
            selling a <b>service.</b> <br></br>
            <br></br>When choosing a <b>service based business</b>, you have a
            ton of options to choose from:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ">

              <b>SEO Services</b>

            <br></br>
            The key here is to pick a business model that not only is{" "}
            <b>lucrative</b>, and something <b>worth selling</b>, but also{" "}
            <b>easy to learn.</b> Which is why I would recommend{" "}
            <b>copywriting.</b>

            <br></br>What is copywriting?{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Copywriting is the art of <b>selling through the use of words.</b>{" "}
            You are carefully analysing the situation to understand how to
            formulate your words with the end goal of{" "}
            <b>driving revenue to a business.</b>
            <br></br>
            <br></br> Explaining the entire concept and how to do this is quite
            a lengthy task, to expedite this process head over to{" "}
            <a

              https://z-lib.is

            and read up on how to do copywriting <b>successfully.</b> I‚Äôve
            compiled a list of books which are available in the YouTube
            description from the website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Practise this skill and by learning from the books, refine your
            skill and then sell it to businesses.

            You are going to actively create content around what you‚Äôre doing,
            the benefits from this are the following:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside ">
            <li>
              You build an audience of people that are interested in what you‚Äôre

            </li>
            <li>You can leverage your audience when doing business deals.</li>
            <li>
              You can monetize the audience by creating digital
              products/services that show them how to do what you do.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can even stop doing the business model and become a coach
              teaching people how to do what you once did.
            </li>
