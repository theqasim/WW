          Building a business with $0:
        </h2>
        <p>
          You have no capital so you need to sell something that requires no
          costs, apart from your time. Which is why you will be selling a
          service.
        </p>
        <p>Choose a service for your business:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ">
          <li>
            <b>SEO Services</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Web Design</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Graphic Design</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Software Developer</b>
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Copywriting</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The key here is to pick a business model that not only is lucrative,
          and something worth selling, but also easy to learn. Which is why I
          would recommend copywriting.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-center">What is copywriting?</h2>
        <p>Copywriting is the art of selling through the use of words. </p>
        <p>
          You are carefully analysing the situation to understand how to
          formulate your words with the end goal of driving revenue to a
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explaining the entire concept and how to do this is quite a lengthy
          task, to expedite this process head over to{" "}

            https://z-lib.is

          and read up on how to do copywriting successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve compiled a list of books which are available in the YouTube
          description from the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practise this skill and by learning from the books, refine your skill
          and then sell it to businesses.
        </p>
        <p>This particular skill allows to do the following:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ">
          <li>
            <b>Sell something with no cost.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Give the business extra revenue which increases your value to
              them.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>It&apos;s scalable as you can train people to work for you.</b>
          </li>

          It&apos;s truly never been easier to build an audience online,
          I&apos;ve done this for years and by far the best platform to get
          exposure quickly is TikTok. I&apos;ve consistently posted low effort
          videos on there and I&apos;ve brought in a lot of views. No fancy
          edits, just me talking to my target audience to leverage that
          elsewhere.

          You are going to actively create content around what you&apos;re
          doing, the benefits from this are the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ">
          <li>
            <b>
              You build an audience of people that are interested in what
              you&apos;re doing.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>You can leverage your audience when doing business deals.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              You can monetize the audience by creating digital
              products/services that show them how to do what you do.
            </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              You can even stop doing the business model and become a coach
              teaching people how to do what you once did.
            </b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This business is by far the easiest way to make money online.</p>
