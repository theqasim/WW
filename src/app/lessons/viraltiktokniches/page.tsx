        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-center">The Fish News Niche:</h2>
        <p>
          The first niche I want to mention is the news niche, now you&apos;re
          probably thinking, news is a very broad niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the way we&apos;re going to approach it is vastly different to
          other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re going to use a character to tell the news to make it more
          entertaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great example of this is fishnewsdaily who uses the fish from
          spongebob to talk about news, and they bring in MILLIONS of views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loads of people are using the fish as it&apos;s seen success but you
          can literally use any character or cartoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key is to use a character that people are familiar with as it will
          catch their attention when scrolling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of this the south park news station, they&apos;re
          bringing in MILLIONS of views super easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          A warning with this is that if you&apos;re using these characters, you
          may run into copyright issues given this is from copyrighted media,
          but here&apos;s how to get around this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go onto fiver, and look up cartoon artist, give them your reference
          and tell them to recreate the character with variations and possibly
          in a different colour or style.
        </p>
        <p>
          That way the character is still recognizable to the viewer, but it is
          not directly using copyrighted media so your videos are at less of a
          risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to the news report, you can be a broad page that reports
          on anything happening in the world, as that has mass audience appeal,
          or even niche down and tie your character to the niche you cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re not fully sold on the character idea, you can take a
          faceless approach so it is more direct.A great example of this is
          nomoredanny who takes clips related to the news that&apos;s happening,
          clips them together and has an AI voice narrating over it with
          captions on the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past 30 days we have brought in 30M views which is over $30,000
          views for making very easy content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that originally and being unique will be your advantage,
          there&apos;s a reason why tons of people do Reddit story videos and
          get no views. It&apos;s because everyone does it, put your own spin on
          it and watch the views come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a great niche to do as you don&apos;t come up with the content
          yourself, you simply report what is happening in the world and bring
          in a ton of money.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-center">

        <p>

          with this.

          The AI Generates Videos Niche:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Moving onto the next niche, we have AI generated videos, but not in
          the way you think.
        </p>
        <p>
          GPT-4 is now integrated with images, which chatgpt the ultimate
          content creation tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can literally give it any prompt and it will generate detailed
          content that you can use.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page (https://www.tiktok.com/@aistorymaster_) is creating swipe
          format content where they have minecraft parkour in the background,
          and have an ai voice read out the chatgpt prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page is bringing in MILLIONS of views just by copying emerging
          trends with this type of content and is bringing in THOUSANDS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s super easy to make as you&apos;re creating either a video or a
          carousel where the image progressively gets more detailed towards a
          certain theme, whether it be uglier, cuter, angrier etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can literally bring in MILLIONS of views without creating any
          content and taking a few screenshots.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind, this will get saturated very quickly, so examine what
          works, put your own spin on it and watch the money and views come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          So very simply, you need to pick a niche to make content and money in,
          I&apos;d suggest you pick any of the following niches:
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-center">
          There is a video resource with this lesson, click{" "}
          <a className="text-blue-500" href="/videos/10kamonthin2024">

          </a>{" "}
          to watch me breakdown a creators entire traffic funnel spanning across
          different platforms. Importantly, how you can copy their strategy too.
